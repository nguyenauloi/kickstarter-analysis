# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project will examine the viability of a proposed theaterical production based on crowdfunding data from Kickstarter, a platform for individuals or groups to propose ideas to be crowd funded. 

### Purpose
Louise is an up and coming playwright who wants advice on how to create a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for her new play: Fever. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The dataset, while informative, did not give us the information that we needed. This requires us to manipulate the data in such a way to present information relevant to what we're trying to convey for Louise e.g., Average Donations, Error %, Date Created/Ended

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From our graph we are able to draw the conclusion that the month a project is launched is related to the outcome. For example, a project that launches in late spring/early summer is most likely to succeed while a project that is launched in October has the highest chance to fail. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Besides the flip from $20,000 to $35,000 our graph indicates that there is an inverse relationship between the funding goal and the outcome, where the higher the goal the more likely the campaign is to fail. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

With the information we know, the recommendation to Louise is to have everything prepared for launch by April so that they can have a smooth launch the following month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Projects have the highest chance of succeeding if the goal is between <$1000 to $15,000 and between $35,000 to $40,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset doesn't include the amount of releases/shows that were also available during each month. It's possible that the lacking months are 'out-of-season' or that the lacking months could have an oversaturation of shows to choose from. These two are just an example of outside forces that could be affecting funding. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Outcomes based on Country or Outcomes based on the Number of Backers would be beneficial to see. As launching in a theater-oriented country could have smaller average donors, but more overall.
